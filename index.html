	<h1>About Guillermo!</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Hello, my name is Guillermo Flores and I am a 17 year old guy who likes to play rhythm games and tinker around with computers. My interest for Rhythm games started back in 2011. My first ever rhythm game was Just Dance 3. My love for computers also started a year later with me getting my first laptop.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I tend to be quiet most of the time as I am not the type of person to talk a lot. My favorite food has to be pizza. If you are wondering what kind of pizza I like then I want to let you know that it is pepperoni and pineapple pizza. You must be disgusted for reading that, but I promise you that it actually taste really good. People make it seem like it doesn't belong on pizza, but when I say it taste good, it does.</p>

	<p>I currently bought a 1990 Mazda Miata MX-5 on the second hand market. The MX-5 Miata is a convertible sports car that was made from 1989 to 1997. I also am a big fan of the pop-up headlights. I am currently working on the car since it has its own flaws. Still I love it and I can't wait for senior year to bring it to school.</p>
